# SkyCast
SkyCast uses OpenWeather API to show weather information.

## why this project?
- I mainly built this project to brush up on some JavaScript concepts and implement tailwind CSS.
- Please use your own API key, go to [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) and signup then [create your API key](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys)
- Edit the first line of script.js
  ```javascript
  const api = "YOUR API KEY GOES HERE"
  ```
